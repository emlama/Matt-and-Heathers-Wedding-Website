			<h2>Orientation to the Area</h2>
			<p>While the wedding itself will be in a neighborhood called Charles Village, it is recommended that guests stay in Harbor East or close by at the Sleep Inn. To help orient you, there are four main neighborhoods to consider:</p>

			<p><strong>1) Harbor East</strong> where the Marriott is located, just east of the inner harbor, is home to a variety of new boutiques and stores (Anthropology and Urban Chic) as well as Whole Foods, a movie theatre and a variety of chain and local restaurants. It is a great area to walk around.</p>

			<p><strong>2) Inner Harbor</strong> is just next to Harbor East and was developed decades ago, but today is still the main tourist area with an aquarium and science museum.</p>

			<p><strong>3) Fells Point</strong> is home for us, located just east of Harbor East where cobblestone streets are lined with restaurants, bars, stores and more bars. This area has something for everyone including history and good music.</p>

			<p><strong>4) Little Italy</strong> is just north of Harbor East, a few blocks north of Whole Foods. It is a tiny area with a variety of restaurants - some good and some ok, but cute to walk around.</p>
