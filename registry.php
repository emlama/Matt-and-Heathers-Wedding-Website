			<h2>Gift Recommendations</h2>

			<p>We greatly appreciate everyone traveling to attend our wedding and view it as an excellent gift! </p>

			<p>However, if you would like to gift us something we kindly ask that you do not buy physical gifts - our teeny-tiny home is bursting - but instead contribute to our savings for the following:</p>

			<p><strong>1) honeymoon fund</strong> - We are headed to Vietnam for a few weeks of backpacking and diving, looking forward to eating at some of the best locations in the country and taking in the sights Vietnam offers.</p>
			<p><strong>2) travel bicycles</strong> - Always on a place here or there, we look forward to travel bikes that we can take along with us where-ever we go!</p>
